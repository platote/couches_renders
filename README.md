# couches_renders
Generating multiples renders of couches from @byWassies

## ADDON SETUP
    1) Download the whole folder, and work within this folder
    2) Open the Blender file. Go to Edit -> Preferences -> Addons -> Install and select render_batch_coutches.py (a panel "COUCHES" is there like pic below
## CAMERA & LIGHTS SETUP
    3) There is a couch already there, you can add lights and position the camera to get a good render
    4) Once you are satisfied, click the "Delete everything except camera & lights" so that you have a clean scene with 0 objects except for camera and lights
## TEST RENDER
    5) Without checking the box "Generate Batches", you can try rendering a specific couch (for instance, if you want couch 11187, put 11187 in id1, and 11187 in id2
    6) The test renders will be put in the folder pngcouches
## RENDER BATCHES
    7) If you want now to render batches, you can simply put the range of couches in id1, id2 (ex : if you want the couches between 0 and 1000, input [0, 1000]
